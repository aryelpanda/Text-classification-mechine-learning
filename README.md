## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the gender of an author based on a given text. Using machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), this project aims to classify text data and provide insights into text-based gender classification.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, vectorization, and text cleaning.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Implemented to provide initial results for gender classification.
- **KNN Classifier**: Used for comparison with the Naive Bayes approach.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Accuracy scores, confusion matrix, and visualizations for result analysis.
